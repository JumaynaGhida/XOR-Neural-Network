## 👨‍💻 About the Creator  

This project was developed by **Jumayna AbdelHay Ghida**, an **AI student at Delta University**, **Student ID: [4221107]**.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a simple neural network implemented in Python using **NumPy** to solve the **XOR problem**, a fundamental challenge in early artificial neural networks.  

## 📌 Why is this Code Important?

The XOR problem is a classic example in machine learning that demonstrates the need for **non-linear models**. A simple perceptron cannot solve XOR because it is not linearly separable. This project implements a **basic feedforward neural network with one hidden layer**, allowing it to learn the XOR function through **backpropagation** and **gradient descent**.  

### 🔹 **Key Features:**
- **Custom-built neural network** (without frameworks like TensorFlow/PyTorch).  
- **Backpropagation and gradient descent** for weight updates.  
- **Sigmoid activation function** for non-linearity.  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function** for training.
